# Banner Component

This directory contains the Banner component converted from Figma's exported HTML/CSS.

- Banner.js: React component that renders the absolute-positioned design using design-system variables and helper classes.
- Banner.css: Minimal screen-scoped helpers (keeps absolute positioning). Most properties are inline to preserve pixel-perfect mapping.
- Common tokens are imported via `src/styles/common.css`.

Assets used by this component (images) are referenced from `/assets/...` which are served from the public folder.
